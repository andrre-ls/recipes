# Recipes

A curated collection of my favorite recipes, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and organized for easy access and sharing. This repository serves as a sort of personal cookbook, a centralized place where I can save and iterate upon the recipes I cook most frequently. The guiding principle behind the project is simplicity and clarity: concise, utilitarian recipes without unnecessary narrative or filler.
