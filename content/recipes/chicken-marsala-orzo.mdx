# Chicken Marsala Orzo

## Ingredients

1. 4 (6-to 8-oz.) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1" pieces
2. 1 tsp. Italian seasoning
3. Kosher salt
4. Freshly ground black pepper
5. 1/4 c. all-purpose flour
6. 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
7. 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided
8. 8 oz. cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
9. 1 shallot, finely chopped
10. 3 cloves garlic, sliced
11. 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh thyme
12. 8 oz. orzo
13. 1 c. dry Marsala wine
14. 2 c. low-sodium chicken broth
15. 1/2 c. heavy cream
16. 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

## Method

1. Pat chicken dry and transfer to a large bowl. Add Italian seasoning; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over chicken and toss to coat.
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 Tbsp. oil, then melt 1 Tbsp. butter. Add half of chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining chicken.
3. In same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 Tbsp. oil. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Add shallots and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.
5. Cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add orzo and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter and cook, tossing frequently, until orzo is coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping browned bits from bottom of pan, until slightly reduced, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Add broth and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavors have melded, about 7 minutes.
7. Add cream and cook, stirring frequently, until orzo is creamy, about 2 minutes more.
8. Return chicken to pan and toss to combine; season with salt, if needed. Top with parsley.
